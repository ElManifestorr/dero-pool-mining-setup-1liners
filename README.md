# dero-pool-mining-setup-1liners

These are the scripts that will be hosted and pointed to on The Wild-Wild West Mining Pool website: https://thewestiswild.com. 

The front end of the website is not up yet, however the scripts should work now. 

THE POOL ITSELF IS UP NOW AN ABLE TO BE MINED WITH. 

If you'd like to mine to the pool now use the arguement '--daemon-rpc-address=thewestiswild.com:10300' when launching your miner.

If you're running into any issues DM me on twitter @burntboi or on discord @ ElManifestorr#6321 so I can get them fixed ASAP!

We appreciate you choosing to use our pools and look forward to getting a heavy bag together! 

Pool fees are 4%. 2% goes to the developers and 2% goes to pool owner. 
Automated payouts occur every 4800 blocks & everyone who contributes for any amount of time is guaranteed to be paid so long as the pool finds a single block. 


*The first 10 users to connect and mine using the pool for at least 1 day will qualify to receive an airdropped NFT from an upcoming collection we're also working on :)*
